### Step 2: Send Messages via API

1. Get a 24-hour access token.
2. Use the `curl` example provided or convert it to [Python with requests](https://github.com/daveebbelaar/python-whatsapp-bot/blob/main/start/whatsapp_quickstart.py).
3. Create your `.env` file using `.env.example`.
4. Expect the "Hello World" message within ~60‚Äì120 seconds.

### Extend Token Duration

- Create a [System User](https://business.facebook.com/settings/system-users).
